# ElectroHub

Hello Welcome to _ElectroHub\_ Website_

This is website will help you to buy or sell your desired Digital Electronics

I have asked many People about this problem where people face In Rwanda, many people want to buy electronics fast, but they struggle to:
see real prices
compare products
get clear description/specs
contact seller quickly
So they end up wasting time asking “price?” on WhatsApp for every item.
Why it matters: It slows business, customers lose trust, and sales drop.
